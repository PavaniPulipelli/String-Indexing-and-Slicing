String Indexing:
- Strings in Python are indexed, where each character has a position.
- Positive indexing starts from 0 (left to right).
- Negative indexing starts from -1 (right to left).

String Slicing:
- Slicing allows extracting a portion of a string using [start:stop:step].
- start: The starting index (inclusive).
- stop: The stopping index (exclusive).
- step: The step value (default is 1).
